Things to add:
1. Languages (more of them at least lol)
2. Errors (for example uploading the incorrect file type. Should redirect you to say "Incorrect file type submitted."
Not just "Server Error"). FIXED: When there is no flie uploaded
4. Color palate is sorta ugly
5. add in the "real time" aspect w/ this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuKXlpJhsp4&t=325s
